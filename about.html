            <li>
              Since our start in 2009, we have performed DJ services for 1000
              weddings and events of all sizes in and around the Calgary area,
              including many large scale events – with over 1000 guests – for
              companies like McDonalds Canada, Westjet, Enterprise Rent-A-Car
              Alberta, Shell Canada, The Calgary Stampede and many others.
              Please have a look at the “Reviews” section to learn more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile DJ companies often hire inexperienced DJ’s to cover their
              events and pay them only a small portion of the cost charged to
              you. Each of our DJ’s has years of previous professional
              entertainment experience in various industries and are personally
              committed to the company’s success. Although we’ve had many
              inquiries for positions with our company; because of our
              commitment to professional and reliable DJ’s, quality equipment,
              and a personalized client focus; only five DJ’s and event bookings
              are available for each date (Please book well in advance for well
              sought-after dates).

            <li>
              Because we realize that many are working with specific budgets,
              our standard pricing is easily accessible through our instant
              quote system. However, Please consider that every DJ and
              entertainment company will offer a different experience or level
              of service and it is for this reason that we do not recommend
              simply ‘price-shopping’ for the most inexpensive DJ service.

              Our Tips and Advice When Considering a DJ Service:
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering a DJ service for your wedding, corporate or social
              event? We’d like to offer some tips and advice to help ensure you
              find a professional and reliable service that best suits your
              needs. Some important considerations include:
              <p>
                Do they have references from recent clients? (Reviews should be
                available on independent online review sites such as google and
                wedding wire).
              </p>

              <p>
                How many hours will they play for? How much is overtime? Is
                dinner/background music included? For weddings, do you get to
                meet well in advance and discuss the evening with the DJ that
                will be performing your wedding? (You will often meet the owner
                who then sends out a DJ for the event. Be firm that you want to
                meet the actual DJ if it’s important to you).
              </p>
              <p>
                Are they professional, interactive and fun, or just cheesy? (You
                can get a sense of this when you meet them).
              </p>
              <p>
                Is the DJ present for dinner and speeches to adjust the music
                and microphone?(Especially important for wedding services as
                guests speak throughout dinner).
              </p>
