                The close-up illusionist “Acetrife” is highly sought after for
                his personable performances and charm that turn audiences into
                close friends. He has been featured in television programs
                (“ABS-CBN Showtime” as seen by millions around the world in
                2010), newspaper articles, and has performed for stars such as
                former Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla and Olympian Cassie
                Campbell. He currently performs private functions as well as on
                a weekly basis at the Calgary Airport surprising global
                travelers.

                A live, experienced and professional pianist can elegantly
                perform at your event or wedding (during cocktail/dinner music)

                This pianist obtained his A.R.C.T. from the Royal Conservatory
                of Music, and graduated from the University of Calgary with a
                BMus. in Piano Performance. While studying there, he had the
                opportunity to work with such artists as Paul Badura-Skoda and
                Emanuel Krasovsky, and to attend the Académie Musicale
                Internationale “Barbara Krakauer” in Vaison-la-Romaine, France.
                More recently, he was featured as a soloist with the Calgary
                Philharmonic Orchestra.

                This guitarist studied classical/Spanish guitar with the
                Victoria Conservatory of Music, the Royal Conservatory of Music,
                and Vancouver Island University for Jazz studies. He was
                fortunate enough to play some venues including Flamenco guitar
                for the Musical “Man of the La mancha” in Nanaimo, Kiss me Kate
                and 100 years of Broadway. Also played with Arnold Chycoski
                (lead trumpet for Canadian Boss Brass), Hugh Fraser, Brian
                Stovall (Diana Krall’s previous teacher) and many other
                fantastic west coast jazz artists.

                For the classical and elegant atmosphere during cocktails or
                dinner, or as a wedding ceremony service, we are able to provide
                a number of stringed performers (Violin, Cello, Viola, and
                Harpist) individually or as String Duos (two violin, violin with
                classical guitar, violin wth cello), a String Trio (violin with
                viola and cello), and String Quartet (two violins, viola, and
                Cello). All of these insrumental performers are current or
                former performers with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra.

                Dance instruction as a group lesson is a great way to help get
                the crowd up and moving on the dancefloor (line dance, salsa,
                electric slide, ballroom or others). This instruction is not
                offered as in depth dance training, but rather as a fun way to
                get people up and started on the dance floor. (combinations are
                geared towards the general public). Our dance instructor has
                trained in jazz, hip-hop, line-dance, ballroom and others for
                nearly a decade and has performed for crowds of nearly 20 000
                people in the Calgary Stampede Grandstand Show.

                We can also provide young and vibrant outgoing “party guests”
                for part of the dance that are very social, upbeat, and fun
                dancers. These dancers would be up on the dancefloor getting
                things started and enticing your guests to get up and dance
                (this can be especially helpful at corporate or social events if
                you have a difficult dancing crowd or shy guests that need that
                little extra boost to get out there).

                  The A Cappella Fellas have been making music together for 7
                  years now. From their humble beginnings busking near Eau
                  Claire Market in Calgary, the group is now an on- demand
                  powerhouse, entertaining the masses at corporate events,
                  school assemblies, festivals, and private parties. They have
                  two full-length recorded albums under their belt, and a list
                  of clients a mile long. They are available to perform a few
                  chosen songs, or a complete hour to two hour long show based
