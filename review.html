              About 9 months ago I started looking for a Wedding DJ. I had gone
              to a Bridal Event and met a bunch of companies. I booked an
              appointment with 3 companies and after all 3 I knew that Outright
              Entertainment was the right choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              I met the Adam at a local coffee shop and he was wearing a
              professional company branded shirt, had a notepad, and was ready
              to meet. He was professional, clear, and friendly. We went over
              the day step by step and he really listened to what I was saying.
              I told him some of the irregularities of our wedding and he took
              down clear notes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Closer to the wedding I exchanged emails with the company and the
              correspondence was prompt. Emails were answered and feedback
              provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the wedding day Adam arrived early and had everything set up.
              It felt great to not worry about the DJ and set up. Once the dance
              started Adam did his thing and I will say this, I have never seen
              the dance floor at any event fill up and stay filled so quickly.
              The number one feedback my wife and I got from our guests was that
              the music was the best music ever at a wedding.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can’t say enough great things about Austin, Adam, and the team
              at Outright Entertainment. They hit every cue, took care of every
              detail, and all at a really fair price. I highly recommend this
              company and their services.

              Just want to send you a quick thank you for providing us a great
              service on our May 18 wedding at the Enmax conservatory and for
              working with us throughout the whole planning. It was so great of
              you in making sure to accommodate and finding the special song
              that I’ve searched for everywhere but you still managed to find
              it. We really appreciate all your excellent effort in making sure
              that our night turns out perfect. Sean was really amazing. Thank
              you again!

              I just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you so much for
              your service at our wedding. Adam did such a great job and there
              were people dancing until the last minute. We really appreciated
              how professional and organized you were and how easy going Adam
              was with the schedule the day of. We will definitely recommend you
              to anyone who’s looking for a dedicated, talented, and
              professional company. Thank you so much!

              I was just watching my wedding video with my mom, and commenting
              on how much fun the reception was, so thank YOU for that! My mom
              was sold on your company from the minute you played a Johnny Reid
              song when we met you and Adam at a wedding fair. It may have taken
              me a bit longer to decide, but I’m so glad that I booked Outright
              for my wedding. From Adam meeting with us in our home, to your
              flexibility and willingness to go the extra mile really impressed
              me. The dance itself was amazing. Every song was a hit with the
              crowd, and I was barely able to tear myself away from the dance
              floor all night. Adam was the perfect blend of professional and
              fun – exactly what I wanted for my wedding. Again, thank you both
              and I hope your business continues to do well.
